## Biography [(CV)](/assets/CV.pdf)
I am Won-tak Joo, an assistant professor in Sociology and Criminology & Law at the University of Florida.

My research interests are in the areas of social demography, social networks, and computational sociology. Specifically, I study how social and family relationships change across the life course, and how these patterns contribute to social and health inequalities, using a range of quantitative approaches including social network methods, applied econometrics, and demographic techniques.

My current projects explore (1) the socioeconomic differences in social network changes during later life transitions (e.g., disease diagnosis, retirement), and (2) the individual and family consequences of epidemics using large genealogy and census datasets.
