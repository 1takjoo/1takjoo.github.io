### The Rise and Fall of Patrilineage in Korea 1400-1940
<br>
<br>
In this study, we aim to answer three questions using extensive information about genealogies during 1400-1940 from 8 clan books in Korea. First, does the social prestige of ancestors—measured by the formal position in the Joseon government—affect the expansion and survival of patrilineages? Second, does the ancestry matter for all descendants or only selected groups? Third, is there any change in prestige effects when there is a disruption in the governmental system? The results show that patrilineages from prestigious ancestry were more likely to survive, which were sustained across 10 generations for about 300 years. However, prestige had little impact on the size and growth of patrilineage. Further analyses show that prestige selectively mattered for the eldest sons’ lineages. We additionally observe a steep decrease in the association between prestige and patrilineage survival when Joseon Dynasty was going through governmental disorders in the early 1600s and the late 1800s. The results suggest that the interaction between family and state is a key to explaining kinship formation.

_"As shown in the figure, prestigious main lines (i.e., founders were the eldest sons and held formal governmental positions in the Joseon dynasty) were 3 times more likely to continue across 10 generations, comparing with partrilineages from later-born sons with no prestigious position held."_

_"The figure shows a steep decrease in prestige effects on the patrilineage continuation early in the 1600s and late in the 1800s, which corresponds to governmental disorders due to the defeat in the war with the Qing Dynasty in 1637 and the start of Japanese colonial rule in 1897. These patterns suggest that prestigious families could take advantage of their social power only when the governmental system stayed stable."_
