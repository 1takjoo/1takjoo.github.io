### Educational Expansion and Social Connectedness in Later Life
**(February 2021)**
<br>
<br>
This study aims to assess the lifelong effects of educational expansion on social networks in later life, especially focusing on the comparison of birth cohorts before and after the compulsory schooling reforms in eight European Countries in the 20th century. The results show that social networks generally became smaller after the reforms, mainly due to fewer connections with those living geographically close. More importantly, the pattern of social network restructuring was not uniform across the population. The emergence of the modern form of social networks was observed only among men from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. These results imply that the experience of the transition into modern society was highly heterogeneous, resulting in different forms of social life in old ages.
