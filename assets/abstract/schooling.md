### Compulsory Schooling Reforms and Social Connectedness in Later Life
<br>
<br>
This study aims to assess the lifelong effects of educational expansion on social networks in later life, especially focusing on the comparison of birth cohorts before and after the compulsory schooling reforms in eight European Countries in the 20th century. The results show that social networks generally became smaller after the reforms, mainly due to fewer connections with those living geographically close. More importantly, the pattern of social network restructuring was not uniform across the population. The emergence of the modern form of social networks was observed only among men from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. These results imply that the experience of the transition into modern society was highly heterogeneous, resulting in different forms of social life in old ages.

_"In the model with a time window of 7 years (i.e., 7 years before and after the pivotal cohorts), a one-year increase in compulsory schooling years leads to a 0.33 increase in the observed schooling years on average. The F statistic is 26, substantially higher than the rule-of-thumb threshold for a strong first stage."_

_"I adopt random permutation tests where I randomly re-assign the exposure to the reforms within the same country and survey year and re-estimate the first stage and reduced-form regression. As shown in the figure, the baseline estimates—(i) the positive impact of compulsory schooling years on the observed schooling years, and the negative impact of compulsory chooling years on (ii) total network size, (iii) neighbor network size, and (iv) maintained network size during two survey waves—fall in the 0.001 tails of the placebo-reform distribution, suggesting that the observed reform effects may not have arisen by chance."_
