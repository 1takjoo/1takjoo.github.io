## Educational Expansion and Social Connectedness in Later Life
**(February 2021)**
<br> This study examines changes in social networks after the educational expansion, especially focusing on the comparison among birth cohorts before and after the compulsory schooling reforms in eight European Countries in the 20th century. The results show that social networks generally became smaller after the reforms, mainly due to fewer connections with those living geographically close. More importantly, the process of social network restructuring was not uniform across the population, and the emergence of modern social lives shows heterogeneous patterns by gender, country, and family backgrounds. These results imply that the reorganization of social lives in the course of modernization is not uniform and stratified by social resource that help comply with structural changes in society.
