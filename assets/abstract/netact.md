#### The Educational Gradient in Social Network Activation: The Case of Disease Diagnosis in Later Life
**(June 2021)**
<br>
<br>
This study examines changes in health discussion networks at the diagnosis of chronic diseases using a representative sample of the US older population. Results show heterogeneous patterns across levels of education. Older adults with low education lost networks with little health discussion but recruited new members that possibly provided richer health discussion than the existing ones. Those with higher education, on the other hand, promoted health discussion with the maintained networks instead of changing social network members. As a result, the total amount of health discussion decreased more for those with no high school degree. These findings suggest that unsteady activation—high fluctuation in social networks but weak activation of health discussion—can be one mechanism of health disparities in later life. The results also imply that individual actions are embedded in the course of building and dissolving networks in reaction to critical situations.

_"Among those without a high school degree, the probability of losing ties with a high expectation of health discussion was about 0.5 and changed little by comorbidity index, whereas the probability for low health discussion networks increased from 0.5 to over 0.9 with the increase of comorbidity index from 0 to 3. On the contrary, the college-educated had stable probabilities of loss even at disease diagnosis, while the average likelihood of loss was lower for ties with a high level of health discussion (0.4) than those with a middle (0.5) or low health discussion (0.6)."_

_"Tie additions among those without a high school degree were strongly conditional on the level of health discussion: there was a slight increase in the probability of adding high health discussion ties from 0.5 to 0.6 with an increase in comorbidity index from 0 to 3, whereas the probability decreased from 0.8 to 0.3 when the likelihood of health discussion was low. Among the college graduates, network ties with a lower expectation of health discussion had a higher probability of being added on average, while this gap by health discussion got slightly wider with more diagnosed diseases."_

_"Educational differences were marked when the baseline expectation of health discussion was low: among those without a high school degree, health discussion at Wave 2 decreased from 0.6 to 0.3 with an increase in comorbidity index from 0 to 3, whereas the college-educated increased the level of health discussion from 0.6 to 0.8 in the same setting."_
