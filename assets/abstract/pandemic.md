### Longevity and In Utero Exposure to the Influenza Pandemics in the 19th Century
**(May 2021)**

Many studies have explored the health and socioeconomic disadvantage of in utero exposure to influenza pandemics in the 20th century, whereas no study examined human longevity with earlier influenza outbreaks. This study explores lifespan consequences of in utero exposure to influenza pandemics in the 19th century using a large size of genealogy data collected through social media. The results show that people exposed to influenza pandemics in utero or during the early postnatal period have shorter longevity, which is robust to shared social and genetic factors among siblings. We discuss potential mechanisms of in utero effects and implications on the current and future pandemics.

_"We defined the exposure to the pandemics based on the pregnancy stage at exposure by matching individualsâ€™ birthdate and place with the local peak of influenza pandemics in the 19th century. As for the 1830-31 pandemic, there was a 2- and 4-year decrease in longevity for those exposed at birth and during the first three-month postnatal period. The decrease in longevity was steeper for women, leading to a decrease of 4 and 6 years from exposure at birth and during the early postnatal period."_

_"The negative impact of early exposure became weaker when applying higher age thresholds to the study sample, whereas the impact of exposure at birth remained strong and significant even with a threshold of age 50. These results imply that the influnce of pandemic exposure is not limited to early deaths of infants and kids, but extends to those who survived to age 50."_
