### Health, Wealth, and Voting Trajectories in Later Life
**(July 2021)**

**Objectives:** Much of what we know about voting behaviors is based on cross-sectional
comparisons of voters at different ages. This study draws on a unique linkage between the
Wisconsin Longitudinal Study and state voter files to characterize voting trajectories in later
life and explore their determinants.
**Methods:** Using sequence analysis, we identify five voting typologies based on turnout and
voting methods over eight biennial elections. Using multinomial logistic and Poisson
regressions, we examine the role of physical, cognitive, and mental health and wealth in
shaping enfranchisement and civic participation at older ages.
**Results:** Health and wealth are both positively associated with voter turnout, but the negative
impact of poor health on voting declines with increasing wealth. Voting at the polls and early
voting are more common among healthier older adults, whereas absentee voting is more
common among older voters who are more affluent, less healthy, or both. Among those less
wealthy, absentee methods mitigate the impact of poor health for previously active voters, but
do not compensate for a lower turnout rate. In addition to physical and cognitive limitations,
emotional difficulties and depression reduce turnout, particularly among the least wealthy.
**Discussion:** In this sample of older, largely white, primarily Midwestern committed voters,
civic participation at older ages is shaped by individual experiences with wealth and health
across the life course as well as political structures that facilitate or restrict the ability of
individuals to consistently participate in elections.

_"Notably, the majority of older adults in the WLS voted consistently–mostly at polls–throughout the study period. The transitions in voting status, if any, occur from polling-place votes to alternative voting or early deaths, whereas a gradual transition from voting to not voting was not identified as a typical trajectory. These findings suggest that older habitual voters rarely stop voting before their deaths, and actively adopt flexible voting methods for continuing their voting habits."_

_"The figure presents the marginal effects of health and wealth with other covariates at means: one standard deviation increase in health leads to 0.26 more votes with any method, 0.16 more polling-place votes, and 0.18 less absentee votes at the 10th wealth percentile; at the 90th wealth percentile, however, the impact of health is near zero for all dimensions."_
