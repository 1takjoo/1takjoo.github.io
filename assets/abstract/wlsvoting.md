### Health, Wealth, and Voting Trajectories in Later Life
**(July 2021)**

**Objectives:** Much of what we know about voting behaviors is based on cross-sectional
comparisons of voters at different ages. This study draws on a unique linkage between the
Wisconsin Longitudinal Study and state voter files to characterize voting trajectories in later
life and explore their determinants.
**Methods:** Using sequence analysis, we identify five voting typologies based on turnout and
voting methods over eight biennial elections. Using multinomial logistic and Poisson
regressions, we examine the role of physical, cognitive, and mental health and wealth in
shaping enfranchisement and civic participation at older ages.
**Results:** Health and wealth are both positively associated with voter turnout, but the negative
impact of poor health on voting declines with increasing wealth. Voting at the polls and early
voting are more common among healthier older adults, whereas absentee voting is more
common among older voters who are more affluent, less healthy, or both. Among those less
wealthy, absentee methods mitigate the impact of poor health for previously active voters, but
do not compensate for a lower turnout rate. In addition to physical and cognitive limitations,
emotional difficulties and depression reduce turnout, particularly among the least wealthy.
**Discussion:** In this sample of older, largely white, primarily Midwestern committed voters,
civic participation at older ages is shaped by individual experiences with wealth and health
across the life course as well as political structures that facilitate or restrict the ability of
individuals to consistently participate in elections.

_"Among those without a high school degree, the probability of losing ties with a high expectation of health discussion was about 0.5 and changed little by comorbidity index, whereas the probability for low health discussion networks increased from 0.5 to over 0.9 with the increase of comorbidity index from 0 to 3. On the contrary, the college-educated had stable probabilities of loss even at disease diagnosis, while the average likelihood of loss was lower for ties with a high level of health discussion (0.4) than those with a middle (0.5) or low health discussion (0.6)."_

_"Tie additions among those without a high school degree were strongly conditional on the level of health discussion: there was a slight increase in the probability of adding high health discussion ties from 0.5 to 0.6 with an increase in comorbidity index from 0 to 3, whereas the probability decreased from 0.8 to 0.3 when the likelihood of health discussion was low. Among the college graduates, network ties with a lower expectation of health discussion had a higher probability of being added on average, while this gap by health discussion got slightly wider with more diagnosed diseases."_
