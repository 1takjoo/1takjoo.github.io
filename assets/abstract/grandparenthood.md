### Labor Market Consequences of Grandparenthood
**(August 2021)**

Little is known about the labor market consequences of becoming a grandparent. We estimate grandparenthood effects on labor supply and earnings using multigenerational data from 15 complete birth cohorts in Denmark. We find that the labor market consequences of grandparenthood are unequally distributed. Grandparenthood reduces hours worked and earnings only for grandmothers, especially when their daughters give birth as teenagers. The negative effects of grandparenthood are greatest among older and low-income grandmothers. We conclude that the economic consequences of grandparenthood are consistently patterned with gendered norms of caregiving, the caregiving needs of the younger generation, and the ability (or lack thereof) of the older generation to outsource caregiving, even in a generous welfare state.

_"In this study, we focus on the relationship among three generations—grandparents, their children, and grandchildren (G1, G2, and G3, respectively hereafter). In general, grandparent effects on degree employed—the standard measure of labor market participation in Denmark, ranging from 0 to 1000—are more negative when G2 gives birth as a teenager, while the results for male G1 with any G2 and female G1 with male G2 do not give strong evidence of trends.  As for female G1 with female G2, the effects of G2’s non-teen and teen birth are -7 and -19 when G3 is younger than one year, which decreases to -19 and -45 when G3’s age is ten or older. These trends imply that the disadvantage in employment after G2’s childbearing is not recovered even after the growth of G3.."_
