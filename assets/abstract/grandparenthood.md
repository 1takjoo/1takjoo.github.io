Little is known about the labor market consequences of becoming a grandparent. We estimate grandparenthood effects on labor supply and earnings using multigenerational data from 15 complete birth cohorts in Denmark. We find that the labor market consequences of grandparenthood are unequally distributed. Grandparenthood reduces hours worked and earnings only for grandmothers, especially when their daughters give birth as teenagers. The negative effects of grandparenthood are greatest among older and low-income grandmothers. We conclude that the economic consequences of grandparenthood are consistently patterned with gendered norms of caregiving, the caregiving needs of the younger generation, and the ability (or lack thereof) of the older generation to outsource caregiving, even in a generous welfare state.
