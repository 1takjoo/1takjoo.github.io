The aging process includes a fundamental change in social networks, but few prior studies have considered the causal mechanism by which life events affect social network changes. In this study, we investigate how the experience of retirement alters social networks using the data from nationally representative studies on older adults in the USA and 14 European Countries. Using country-specific pension eligibility as an instrumental variable, we show that retirement leads to larger social networks with kin members. According to the test of heterogeneous treatment effects, male older adults with higher education are more like to reorganize their social networks after retirement. We report regional differences in the retirement effect and discuss their implications.
