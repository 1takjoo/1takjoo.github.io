There has been a growing interest in the contribution of social networks to diverging consequences of COVID-19. Using the representative data of older adults in European countries, this study examines the role of social networks in explaining socioeconomic differences in mental health after COVID-19. Results show that older adults with larger pre-pandemic networks—especially with geographically distant members—were more likely to feel depressed, lonely, and have trouble sleeping. Decomposition of educational differences shows that pre-pandemic network structure (i.e., larger distant networks of the higher educated) narrowed the gap in mental health issues, which was largely offset by post-pandemic interactions (i.e., more in-person interactions of the higher educated). On the other hand, decomposition of asset differences suggests that pre-pandemic network structure (i.e., larger geographically close networks of the wealthier) widened the gap in depression. This study shows that COVID-19 made unexpected changes in the relationship between social networks and mental health, requesting attention to such complex dynamics in exacerbating inequalities during the pandemic.
