This study examines the role of social networks in explaining socioeconomic differences in mental health after the onset of COVID-19. Using representative data on European older adults, this study shows that older adults with larger pre-pandemic networks—especially with geographically distant members—were more likely to feel depressed, lonely, and have trouble sleeping after the pandemic. The mental health advantage of those with higher levels of education declined partly because of their larger and more geographically distant network structures. On the other hand, more in-person interactions for those with higher levels of education widened the mental health gap later in the pandemic. A decomposition of asset differences furthermore indicated that the larger pre-pandemic coresidential network structure of wealthier adults provided more protection from depression relative to the networks of less wealthy peers. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health thus clearly varied depending on social networks, warranting more attention to the interplay of social ties and health disparities.
