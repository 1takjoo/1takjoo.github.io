There has been a growing interest in the contribution of social networks to diverging consequences of COVID-19, but the empirical evidence is limited. Using the representative data of older adults in European countries, this study examines the role of social networks in explaining socioeconomic differences in mental health after COVID-19. Results show that older adults with larger pre-pandemic networks—especially with out-of-household members—were more likely to feel depressed and have trouble sleeping, whereas larger in-household networks were associated with a lower risk of depression and loneliness after the pandemic. Decomposition of educational differences shows that pre-pandemic network structure (i.e., larger out-of-household networks of the higher educated) narrowed the gap in depression, which was largely offset by post-pandemic interactions (i.e., more in-person interactions of the higher educated). On the other hand, decomposition of asset differences suggests that pre-pandemic network structure (i.e., larger in-household networks of the wealthier) widened the gap in depression. This study shows that COVID-19 made unexpected changes in the relationship between social networks and mental health, requesting attention to such complex dynamics in exacerbating inequalities during the pandemic.
